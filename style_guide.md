# Style Guide (WIP)

## Textures
### Colors
Ethervoid uses the [Ressurect 64 Pallete](https://lospec.com/palette-list/resurrect-64) for all of its sprites.

### Resolution
Sprites should have a minimum resolution of 16:16. All resolutions should be multiples of 16 (E.G. 32:32 is allowed, 64:256 is allowed, 18:20 is not allowed).

## Code
### Whitespace
ALWAYS use tabs instead of spaces for indenting.
